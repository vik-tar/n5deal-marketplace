# Handover — resume point

Written 2026-09-04, mid-execution, so work can resume after a shutdown.

## Where the work is

- **Branch:** `feat/marketplace-prototype` (never merged to `master`; `master` holds only the two design commits).
- **Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-04-n5deal-marketplace.md` — 23 tasks. It has been amended several times to match reality; trust it over any memory.
- **Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-n5deal-marketplace-design.md`.
- **Full execution ledger:** `docs/superpowers/EXECUTION-LEDGER.md` — every ruling, every deferred minor, every interface fact, in order. This is the file to read first on resume. A live copy also sits at `.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-04-n5deal-marketplace/progress.md`, which is git-ignored scratch and will be destroyed by `git clean -fdx`; the committed copy is the durable one.

## Status: 23 of 23 complete, and the whole-branch review is done

**398 unit tests pass with `DATABASE_URL` set and unset; 3 Playwright specs pass.** typecheck, lint
and build are clean. The database is left seeded. Nothing has been pushed and no remote exists.

The whole-branch review ran as three parallel read-only passes (deferred triage, security,
consistency) followed by three fix rounds — `508c07d`, `d3df631`, `8d6a104`. Its full record is at
the end of `docs/superpowers/EXECUTION-LEDGER.md`.

**Security verdict: no Critical, no High.** One finding was live and the controller reproduced it
before and after: three Server Actions had no authorization check, and an anonymous POST to one of
them returned real data.

## What is left

1. **The branch has never been merged to `master`** — 68 commits here, two design commits there.
2. **Deployment** — the only thing that needs the user: Neon and Vercel accounts reachable through a
   browser. Instructions are written, `postinstall` is verified on a fresh clone, and the README
   holds a URL placeholder.
3. **One open ruling for the user:** on the seller dashboard's top-3 matched buyers, a buyer whose
   mandate constrains nothing is badged "Strong match · 100/100". Two options are recorded in the
   Task 18 ledger entry. Blocks nothing.
4. **A maintainer's backlog**, recorded rather than forgotten: the link-styled-as-button primitive
   (7 hand-rolled copies), the `MatchReason` comparanda finding, the unreachable `included` error
   branch, and a short discretionary tail. All in the ledger with their reasoning.

## Restarting the environment

```bash
open -a Docker                  # the daemon does not survive a reboot
docker start n5deal-pg          # Postgres 16, port 55432; data persists in the container
pnpm install                    # if node_modules is stale
pnpm test                       # expect 398 passing
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm start` on a port other than 3000 fails Auth.js with `UntrustedHost` unless
`AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` is set. Irrelevant on Vercel, relevant for local production-build testing.

`.env` is git-ignored and holds `DATABASE_URL`, a generated `AUTH_SECRET`, and an empty
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. If `.env` is gone, recreate it from `.env.example`; the database URL is
`postgresql://n5deal:n5deal@localhost:55432/n5deal`. If the container was removed rather than
stopped, recreate it and run `pnpm db:migrate` then `pnpm db:seed` — the seed is idempotent and
the demo data is fully reproducible.

Demo logins: `buyer@n5deal.demo`, `seller@n5deal.demo`, `manager@n5deal.demo`, password
`demo1234`.

## What remains

| Task | | Cycle |
|---|---|---|

Full cycle = implementer, task review, and a dispatched scoped re-review after every fix round.
Accelerated = implementer, task review, and one fix round the controller verifies directly from
the diff. This split was the user's decision.

## One thing that still needs the user

1. **Deployment (Task 23) needs Neon and Vercel accounts** reachable through a browser.
   Development runs entirely on the local Docker Postgres.

**Settled, do not reopen:** the user decided on 2026-09-07 that this project ships with
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset. That is the designed configuration — the three AI features hide
themselves and everything else is deterministic — not a gap to close. Task 9 Step 8 is closed as
will-not-do. Do not raise it again, and do not let Task 23 list it as an open item; the README
documents it as the shipping state.

## Handoffs recorded during execution

- Task 18 must reuse `getAssetRequestQueue` and `access-request-queue.tsx` from Task 14 rather
  than reimplementing a seller-side approve/decline surface.
- Task 18 must not render a ranking when `scoreMatch` reports `specificity === 0`, and must label
  what a ranking is based on below 5.
- Task 20 must state the `canAccessApp` semantics settled during Task 12: a suspended viewer
  browses exactly what an anonymous visitor browses and reaches no authenticated surface. The
  predicate's name and comment should say "authenticated surfaces", not "the app".
- 30+ deferred minor findings are listed in the ledger for the final whole-branch review to triage.
